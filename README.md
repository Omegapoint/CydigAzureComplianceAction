# CyDig Azure Task

This repository contains compliance tasks for Azure.

## Development instructions

TODO


By first running ```npm install``` in the root you get the linting and format rules downloaded. So, every time you make a commit, a pre-hook will run to validate the rules (Read more [here](https://github.com/Omegapoint/CydigAzureComplianceAction/blob/main/LinitingAndFormat.md). If there are any violation you will se an error or a warning in the terminal. To fix format warnings run the following command from the **root**:

```bash
npm run format:write
```
